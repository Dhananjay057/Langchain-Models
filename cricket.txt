Beneath the sun on a grassy stage,
With willow wand and ball of rage,
The players gather, brave and bold,
To chase a tale that’s centuries old.

A hush descends, the fielders spread,
The bowler runs with silent tread,
The batter stands with watchful eye,
As leather meets the air to fly.

A crack! A cheer! The ball takes flight,
It dances in the summer light,
The crowd erupts with boundless glee,
As six runs soar in jubilee.

The spinner weaves a magic thread,
The batter’s dreams are hanging by thread,
A flick, a miss — the stumps alight,
A victory shout takes wings in flight.

Tea is poured and tales are shared,
Of epic wins and foes who dared,
Of final balls and chasing fate,
Of moments small that made them great.

More than just a game we play,
It’s heart and grit in bright array,
A test of skill, of mind and soul,
Where every run can chase a goal.

So raise your bat and take your stand,
With dreams as wide as sea and land,
For cricket is not just a sport —
It’s poetry in each report.
